Troubleshooting
ChromeDriver Version Mismatch: If you encounter an error related to ChromeDriver, make sure the version of ChromeDriver matches the version of your Chrome browser. You can download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver here.

Login Issues: Ensure your email and password are correctly entered in the script. Double-check if the login page selectors or placeholders have changed.

Webpage Structure Change: If the page structure or element IDs change on Quso.ai, you may need to update the scriptâ€™s element locators (By.ID, By.CSS_SELECTOR, etc.) to reflect the new structure.
